A large number of the doouments here printed are derived from
the family papers of the late Dr. CARNE, of St. Donat's Oastle, and
from the eolleetion of the late ΜΓ. G. G. FRAncss, of Swansea, to both
of whom I desire to express my obligations. Others vvere found in the
Harleian Oolleofion in the British Museum, and others among the
voluminous family papers of ΜΓ. J orms, of Fonmon Gastle. The
orign‘nals of the Borough Gharters are at Oardiff, nasu-isam, and Kenfig,
exeepting those of Aberavon, for which I am indebted to my friend Sir
H. Hussmr V1vum, long a representative of our Oounty in Parliament.
Ι have also to thank Mr. W. ns Gur Bmcn for ealling my attention
to many of the Museum Gharters, and for his assistance in eorrecting
my proofs, and thus preventing many err-ors.

In my former as in the present volume, the eontents are arranged
in order of time, or, in the absenoe of dates, as nearly so as was prae·
tieable, and the series of doeuments in the present volume is oonfinued
down to the reigns of EmzABn‘rn and J Am, with a few not unimportant

J additions. It has however happened, during the printing of this second

volume, that a mass of demente, ehiefly of the 12th and 13th eenturies,
have eome under my notiee, the number of which, their dates, and their
importanes in Glamorgan history, have rendered neeessaryr a third volume,
which will be of the nature of an appendix to the former two, and
whioh will, with them, Ι hope, form a' very complete oolleetion of the
eharters and early munimenta relating to the Lordships of Glamorgan,
Kilvae, and Gower.
